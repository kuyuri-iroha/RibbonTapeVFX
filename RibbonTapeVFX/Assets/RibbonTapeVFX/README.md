# RibbonTapeVFX

## Overview

![Launching ribbon tape](./Images/2022-05-18%2022-18-13.gif)

VFX for Unity for ribbon tapes used in live performances.

It works by specifying VAT (Vertex Animation Texture) to VFX, and by using Cloth simulation results, realistic ribbon tape effects can be realized in a lightweight manner.

Two types of VAT can be specified: at the time of launch and at the time of fall, and these are interpolated and displayed internally.
